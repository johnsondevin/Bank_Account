# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This is a Bank Account program. It gives a simple way to add an account, view all the accounts provided, deposit to an account, and withdraw from an account.

I wrote this program to learn the programming language C#. I haven't had the chance until now to use this language, and I think that it will benefit me in the future.

Here is a link to a video demonstration of my project.

# Development Environment

To create the program, I used Visual Studio. I was able to learn the basics about the debugger and the compiler, enough to create and run my program with this new software.

I used C#, which is a language created by Microsoft for the development of their software and applications. It has a broad range of uses, including mobile and desktop
applications. It is a very versatile language.

# Useful Websites

Here are some websites that I found to be very useful while creating my project.

- [Microsoft.com (C# Documentation)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [GeeksforGeeks.org (C# Tutorials)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/csharp-programming-language/)

# Future Work

Here are some things that I want to continue in order to further learn how to use C#.

- I want to go through and fix the bugs in my program. There are some bugs that I wasn't able to quite work out, so I want to get some help from some
collegues to fix the bugs.
- I would like to learn about creating a program using C# with a user interface, instead of the console. I think this would help me learn more about
how to create an app.
- I want to find a way to use this language more frequently so that I don't forget everything that I just learned for this project. If I create a project
when I have time, I think I will have a better recollection of this language for when I need it next.
